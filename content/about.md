-------------------

Many developers' personal sites are a showcase of their skills. In my case, I had a baby and 6 weeks later made this, quickly, to do something for myself that wasn't baby related.

I would like it to be better looking and more technically accomplished, but I have come to accept (I type, as my 6 week old baby has become a toddler) that it might be a long time before that happens!
